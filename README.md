Exploratory Data Analysis in python
Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA, is essentially a type of storytelling for statisticians. It allows us to uncover patterns and insights, often with visual methods, within data. EDA is often the first step of the data modelling process. EDA helps to bring out points from datasets that may not be analyzed by standard data science algorithms. EDA helps in better data understanding. EDA is known for capturing and analyzing uncommon data patterns that will be skipped by typical machine learning algorithms. EDA is all about data visualization.
